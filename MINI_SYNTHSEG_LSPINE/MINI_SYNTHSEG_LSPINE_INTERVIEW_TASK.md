Mini-SynthSeg for Lumbar Spine Segmentation

**#1 Assignment Description**

As an ML Research Scientist at SwiftSight, you need to design a minimal CPU-viable problem and implement a simplified version of the SynthSeg approach for robust lumbar spine segmentation. The goal is to train a segmentation model using synthetic MRI data that generalizes better than traditional supervised learning. Please submit a ZIP file containing working code and documentation.

**Your submission must include:**

1. **Working Implementation**
   - Python script(s) implementing synthetic MRI generation from SPIDER spine label maps
   - Two trained models: one using synthetic data, one using real data
   - Evaluation pipeline comparing robustness
   - One example script demonstrating the full pipeline

2. **README.md** containing:
   - **Setup instructions**: How to install and run
   - **Usage examples**: How to generate synthetic data and train models
   - **AI tool usage notes**: Which tools you used and how (see guidelines below)

3. **ANALYSIS_REPORT.md** containing:
   - **Background Research**: What is SynthSeg? Why does synthetic training improve generalization?
   - **Minimal Problem Design**: How you defined the task (e.g., simplified class labels, model size, data size) and why
   - **Implementation Details**: Your synthetic data generation strategy
   - **Experimental Results**: Comparison between synthetic vs real training
   - **Analysis**: Why does synthetic training work (or not) for spine segmentation?

**#2 AI Tool Usage Guidelines**

We strongly encourage you to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) for any part of this assignment.

**In your README, briefly document:**
- Which AI tools you used
- 2-3 example prompts that were particularly helpful
- One instance where you disagreed with or had to correct an AI suggestion

**Core Features Required:**

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Generate synthetic spine MRI from label maps
   - Implement intensity sampling for different tissues (vertebrae, discs, spinal canal)
   - Add at least ONE realistic artifact (bias field, noise, or motion)
   - Support contrast variation (T1-like to T2-like spectrum)
   - Resolution variation (1-4mm)

2. **Model Training**
   - Train Model A: Using ONLY synthetic data (no real images)
   - Train Model B: Using real SPIDER images (baseline)
   - Same architecture for fair comparison
   - Log training metrics

3. **Evaluation**
   - Standard test on T2 validation images
   - Contrast shift test (e.g., test on T2 when trained on T1-like)
   - Resolution degradation test
   - Report Dice scores per structure (vertebrae, disc, canal)

4. **Open Research Questions**: Propose and explore your own investigation into synthetic training.
   *(For inspiration, not selection: reality gap tuning, pathology handling, feature visualization, failure modes...)*

**Dataset:** SPIDER lumbar spine MRI (open-source). Please select a subset of the data for your experiment for proof of concept (e.g., ~40 samples).

**#4 Implementation Details**

**Part 1: Synthetic Generator**

Implement `SpineSynthGenerator` class with:
```python
def generate_synthetic_mri(self, label_map):
    """
    1. Sample tissue intensities based on contrast type
    2. Add one artifact (bias field, motion, or noise)
    3. Apply resolution variation
    """
    return synthetic_image
```

**Part 2: Model Training**

- Use provided 2D U-Net (`models/unet.py`) or modify as needed
- Training loop with Dice loss
- Model A: Synthetic-only training (from T1 labels)
- Model B: Real T1-only training

**Part 3: Evaluation**

Test on T2 validation set with metrics:
- Per-structure Dice coefficient
- Robustness to contrast shifts
- Robustness to resolution changes

**Part 4: Open Research Question**

Propose and investigate your own research questions (see Core Features #4).

**#5 FAQ**

**Q. Do I need to implement my own model?**
**A.** No, we provide a 2D U-Net in `models/unet.py`. Feel free to modify as you needed.

**Q. Do I need a GPU?**
**A.** No, the provided U-Net is lightweight and all tasks are CPU-runnable.

**Q. What if my synthetic model performs worse?**
**A.** That's totally fine! Analyze why and document your findings for potential improvement strategies.

**Q. Can I simplify the task?**
**A.** Yes! Feel free to simplify the problem to make it more tractable (e.g., fewer structures labels). Document your simplifications and justify why they help demonstrate the core SynthSeg concept.

**Q. How much data do I need?**
**A.** For the proof of concept, download a small desired subset from the open-source SPIDER challenge dataset.

**Q. How much time should this take?**
**A.** Aim for ~8 hours of work. Again, we strongly recommend you to work with AI tools. Focus on core concepts over perfect performance.

**#6 Evaluation Points**

- Does the problem clearly defined and compact?
- Is the implementation correct and well-documented?
- Are the results properly evaluated and interpreted?
- Is there clear understanding of domain randomization principles?
- Is the research question well-defined and investigated?

**#7 Submission**

- **Timeline:** One week (extensible - just let us know)
- **Format:** ZIP file named `[YourName]_SynthSegSpine.zip`
- **Contact:** For questions, email [jung.woojin@airsmed.com]
